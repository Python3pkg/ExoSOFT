Extremely basic start-up tutorial.

Dependencies:
-------------
Note: Installing python packages with pip is best as it handles the version and 
dependency issues for you.  Here are the dependencies for ExoSOFT.

## Those NOT available on pip
# gcc
# gcc-c++
# texlive-epstopdf
# pip (extra to make installing packages below easier)

#Available for install with pip
python2.7 or higher
numpy
pyfits
scipy
pylab
matplotlib
psutil
swig
astropy
PyAstronomy


Install & Run:
--------------
1. unzip in directory of choice 
   (lets say '/home/ExoSOFT/' for demonstration purposes.)
2. open '/home/ExoSOFT/exosoft/exosoftpath.py' and update the directory string
   for rootDir.
3. open the settings.py file in '/home/ExoSOFT/examples/' and update the 
   directories in the keys 'outDir', 'DIdataFile' and 'RVdataFile' 
   on lines 39-47.
4. Possibly not be necessary, but the cpp files might require being compiled 
   again on your machine to run.
   If so, from a bash terminal:
	$cd '/home/ExoSOFT/exosoft/tools/cppTools/'
	$make clean
	$make
   NOTE: If you have difficulties compiling, make sure SWIG is installed 
         correctly.  The documentation for this is provided here:
	 http://www.swig.org/Doc3.0/Preface.html#Preface_osx_installation
5. If the directories are updated to match the location on your machine and the 
   cpp code compiled, let's try and run ExoSOFT by:
	$cd '/home/ExoSOFT/exosoft/'
	$python ExoSOFT.py
6. If it runs properly, then check the outputs when finished in the directory 
   you set 'outDir' to.  Else, the errors are most likely dependancy based, so 
   please check the traceback to solve.  Setting the 'logLevel' on line 25 of 
   settings.py to 10 will give you all the debug messages to help track down 
   the problem.
7. The current settings are the minimum to converge to a single posteriors peak
   and perform all three stages of ExoSOFT in a couple minutes.  Running it for 
   more samples by increasing the 'nSamples' parameter at the top or increasing 
   the 'nChains' and 'nMCMCcns' to higher matching values would be produce more 
   well sampled posteriors.  For example, 7 chains each of 5e7 were used to 
   produce the results in the ExoSOFT release paper, which took our computer 
   ~5hrs to complete.
